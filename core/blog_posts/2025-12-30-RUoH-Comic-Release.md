We’re starting to release a new comic under the **Research Unit of Horrors** name:  
**_Research Unit of Horrors: Side-Quests_**.

These comics will be published directly on this website (for the best reading quality), and also shared on
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/researchunitofhorrors) and
[Webtoon](https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/research-unit-of-horrors-side-quests/list?title_no=913183) to help reach new audiences.

## What Side-Quests are

Side-Quests are short, self-contained stories focused on the characters rather than the main plot. They’re lighter in tone, more comedic, and intentionally low-stakes.

This format allows us to:

- Explore character dynamics and personalities  
- Experiment with writing and humor  
- Test visual and pacing ideas in a faster format  

## How they fit into the larger story

Side-Quests are **semi-canon**.

They won’t contradict the main lore, but they’re also not required reading for the core storyline. Events in Side-Quests won’t be referenced in the main plot, which is planned to be **darker, more serious, and more story-driven**.

Think of them as parallel experiments — same world, same characters, different intent.

## Why we’re doing this

These comics give us space to:

- Find the right voice for each of the characters  
- Refine tone before locking the final version  
- Build familiarity with the cast before the main story launches  

The long-term goal is to animate the main Research Unit of Horrors storyline, with a more focused narrative and higher stakes. Side-Quests help us get there without rushing creative decisions.


More pages and chapters will start coming out soon.
