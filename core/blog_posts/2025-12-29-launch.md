The Uranium Core is officially live.

This site is where our animation work, original projects, and ongoing experiments will live moving forward. It’s built to be simple, flexible, and focused on showing the work clearly.

## What’s here now

- Our animation reel and featured projects  
- Original series pages like *Research Unit of Horrors*  
- A blog for updates, breakdowns, and production notes  

## How we work

We focus on clean, stylized 2D animation with a strong technical pipeline. The goal is to support ideas—not bury them under noise. We value clear communication, realistic timelines, and repeatable workflows that actually hold up in production.

## What’s next

- More series updates and art drops  
- Behind-the-scenes posts about process and tooling  
- New animated releases and experiments  

If you’re interested in collaborating or commissioning work, feel free to reach out. More soon.
