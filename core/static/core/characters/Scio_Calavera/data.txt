NAME: SCIO CALAVERA
NICKNAME: "The Philosopher of Ruin"

BIO:
Scio Calavera is a natural philosopher from Mainake, recognized for his highly unorthodox advancements in chemistry, biology, and mechanical engineering. His work consistently exceeds the scientific standards of his era, combining organic matter, volatile substances, and experimental machinery into functional—often unstable—systems. Despite lacking physical strength or combat training, Calavera’s inventions have repeatedly proven effective in sabotage, area denial, and asymmetric warfare.

Currently operating from a subterranean laboratory beneath the independent city of Roche-Bleu, Calavera leads a small and unconventional research unit composed of soldiers, assistants, and anomalous entities. He is widely regarded as brilliant but ethically compromised, exhibiting obsessive focus, manipulative leadership, and little concern for collateral consequences. Among analysts, Scio Calavera is considered less a conventional scientist and more a destabilizing force whose work blurs the boundary between innovation, catastrophe, and forbidden knowledge.
