NAME: Zara
NICKNAME: "The Unbound Current"

BIO:
Zara is a Kharashi-born magic practitioner whose abilities place her among the most volatile individuals in the Research Unit. Born in 462 to a mixed-heritage family, she was raised within Kharashi communal structures that maintained magical traditions long abandoned by most of AeterNicht. Following the political collapse of Mainake and the criminalization of so-called “ungodly magic,” Zara became displaced at an early age, surviving independently across multiple regions with minimal external support.

Known for her erratic behavior, open defiance of authority, and extreme disregard for personal safety, Zara nevertheless demonstrates exceptional combat potential. Over time, she has developed advanced applications of High-Tension Kharashi Arts, combining electrical manipulation, close-quarters martial techniques, and large-scale summoning rituals. While initially uncontrolled and destructive, her abilities show exponential growth when paired with discipline and study. Analysts note that Zara represents a rare convergence of raw power, adaptability, and long-term threat potential unmatched by any known contemporary practitioner.
