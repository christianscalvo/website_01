NAME: SAMHAIN
NICKNAME: "The Monster from The Lab"

BIO:
Samhain is a cucurbite-born combat entity originating from the Kato Kosmos, documented as possessing extreme physical strength and durability despite his young chronological age. Born in 478 as part of a large cucurbite brood, he exhibited abnormal combat aptitude early in development, particularly in vine manipulation and raw force output. Unlike others of his kind, Samhain showed little interest in leadership or ritual responsibility, instead prioritizing personal strength, combat, and exploration.

After extended activity across multiple regions of the Kato Kosmos, Samhain relocated to the Surface, where his physiology and behavior marked him as immediately hostile to human perception. Operating primarily as a hired combatant and frontline enforcer, he became known for overwhelming battlefield presence, minimal situational awareness, and instinct-driven decision-making. Despite limited cognitive complexity and poor impulse control, Samhain demonstrates unwavering loyalty toward those he considers allies, functioning as a highly effective defensive and assault asset within the Research Unit.
