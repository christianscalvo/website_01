NAME: FREJA VINDERSEN
NICKNAME: "The Last Breath of Winter"

BIO:
Freja Vindersen is an Imperial commander of Danisian origin, widely regarded as one of the most formidable combatants in recorded service. Born in 456 in a rural settlement of the Danisian Isles, she enlisted in the Imperial Army at sixteen and distinguished herself through exceptional physical capability, tactical discipline, and mastery of both infantry and cavalry combat. Her rapid advancement placed her in high-responsibility roles within the capital and later across multiple civil and military operations.

Known for her absolute adherence to order and hierarchy, Freja became a decisive presence in conflict zones where conventional authority failed. Her command history is marked by efficient, often uncompromising resolutions, earning her a reputation as both a legendary warrior and an unyielding instrument of imperial will. By the age of twenty-four, she was considered a veteran of sustained warfare and enforcement, perceived less as an individual officer and more as a controlled force in service of stability.
